Industrial processes and associated sensors in a typical manufacturing production line generate huge volumes of data. The sampling rate varies from 5 to 100 milliseconds. Each data point is called a Tag. There are typically 1000 to 50,000 tags collected overall depending on the industry and the complexity of the process.\n","\n","This task is to transform such data from row format (all tags in a single row) to a column format (one tag per row). In other words, from traditional SQL friendly to NoSQL friendly format.\n","\n","**Note:** Here you can assume the tag is a sensor. tag_name is sensor name and tag_value is sensor reading.\n","\n","**Task**<br/>\n","Transform the data present in ‘Sample Input’ CSV into ‘Sample Output’ CSV using Python.\n","\n","**Details**<br/>\n","See comments in ‘Sample Input’ for column mapping (e.g., ItemId becomes tag__id)\n","\n","**‘Sample Input’** has all tags (sensor readings) captured in one row. Whereas in ‘Sample Output’ we need one tag per row. That’s why it is called a data transformation task.\n","\n","**‘Sample Input’** has data captured every 5 milliseconds. We need to aggregate it to 10 sec using MAX as the aggregation function.\n","\n","<br/>**FAQ**<br/>\n","Q1. When converting from input format to output format, the logic of the tag_values column in the output dataset is not clear.\n","\n","Input data is of high frequency (5 millisec sampling). We need to aggregate it to a 10 second interval using maximum as an aggregate function so that we reduce the no. of records to a manageable size.\n","\n","In 10 seconds we collect a total 2000 samples (each at 5ms interval) for a tag (sensor) in the input data set. This is too much data to handle. We need to shrink it to just one sample per 10 sec by aggregating it.\n","\n","For example, a tag (sensor) generates 2000 values (readings) in a given 10 sec interval (this is Sample Input). tag_value is nothing but the maximum value (sensor reading) of that tag (sensor) in that interval (and this is Sample Output)."],"metadata":{"id":"z_A6S1fccYMc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Import the Libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"cmEfGT80VpBP"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3cMD5AfHVip6"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import csv\n","import re"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Import the Dataset:"],"metadata":{"id":"4AxPK-BGV7Jt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open('Sample Input.csv') as file:\n","  obj = csv.reader(file)\n","  arr1 = []\n","  arr2 = []\n","  # for loop to fill data in lists arr1 and arr2\n","  for index,value in enumerate(obj,start=1):\n","    if index <= 20:\n","      arr1.append(value) #fills data of first 20 rows\n","    else:\n","      arr2.append(value) #fills data of the rest of the remaining rows"],"metadata":{"id":"a-LZN-KjWFNT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Creating Dataframes out of lists."],"metadata":{"id":"kE_aYl0BY3JG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df1 = pd.DataFrame(arr1[1:],columns=arr1[0])\n","df1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"UiezwvQ3Ylqk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702629383250,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyans Mehta","userId":"18192264643597474863"}},"outputId":"ac67e537-e26a-45f4-84ed-3df1237afa39"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   ItemId ComputerId           ItemName  \\\n","0   35827         10     L_R1SDW_SPDREF   \n","1   35828         10     L_R1SDD_SPDREF   \n","2   35829         10     L_R1SDL_SPDREF   \n","3   35830         10     L_R1SDW_SPDFBK   \n","4   35831         10     L_R1SDD_SPDFBK   \n","5   35832         10     L_R1SDL_SPDFBK   \n","6   35974         10   L_R1_ODG_AUX_B07   \n","7   83528         10  RM1_RUNDOWN_ID_HS   \n","8   83530         10      L_R1SD_WS_GAP   \n","9   83531         10      L_R1SD_DS_GAP   \n","10  83532         10   L_R1SD_WS_SPDREF   \n","11  83533         10   L_R1SD_DS_SPDREF   \n","12  83534         10    L_R1SDLS_SPDREF   \n","13  83535         10   L_R1SD_WS_SPDFBK   \n","14  83536         10   L_R1SD_DS_SPDFBK   \n","15  83537         10    L_R1SDLS_SPDFBK   \n","16  83538         10      L_R1SD_WS_CUR   \n","17  83539         10      L_R1SD_DS_CUR   \n","18  83540         10     L_R1_CNT_PASS0   \n","\n","                                   Comment Unit C/S/ID  \\\n","0   R1 Screw Down WS Speed Reference (mps)           0   \n","1   R1 Screw Down DS Speed Reference (mps)           0   \n","2   R1 Screw Down LS Speed Reference (mps)           0   \n","3    R1 Screw Down WS Speed Feedback (mps)           0   \n","4    R1 Screw Down DS Speed Feedback (mps)           0   \n","5    R1 Screw Down LS Speed Feedback (mps)           0   \n","6                    R1 ODG AUX output B07           0   \n","7                            R!
